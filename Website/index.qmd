# Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the course website for Computational Social Science for
Sustainability, developed and taught by Dr. Matthew Turner, and offered Winter
2025 for Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability undergraduates and graduate
students! Join the course to develop a nuanced understanding of human social
behavior while learning new computational and presentation skills in the R
programming language.


## Course structure

We meet twice weekly, currently scheduled for Monday and Wednesday
11:30am-12:50pm, but subject to change, location pending. Each week will have 
twin themes, one social science phenomenon (e.g., political polarization)
and one computational technique or skill (e.g., agent-based modeling).


# Syllabus

Each week will feature one lecture focused on a select topic 
from social science for sustainability (S3).
