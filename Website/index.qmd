# Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the course website for Computational Social Science for
Sustainability, developed and taught by Dr. Matthew Turner, and offered Winter
2025 for Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability undergraduates and graduate
students! Join the course to develop a nuanced understanding of human social
behavior while learning new computational and presentation skills in the R
programming language.

## Getting help

One of the most helpful things students can do is speak up early if they are having trouble. Please  [email me](mailto:maturner@stanford.edu) or seek the help of other enrolled students. 

### Office hours



## Course structure

Each week will have a Monday lecture on topics in computational social science for sustainability. Wednesday meetings will focus on developing programming, analysis, and writing skills in an interactive lab-section setting. In these Wednesday sections students will be introduced to problem sets and midterm and final projects, and have time to ask questions of and work together with the instructor and peers.

### Coursework and Grading

Students will be evaluated based on their completion of six total assignments: four problem sets, a midterm project, and a final project. 

-   **Problem sets:** There will be four problem sets introduced on Wednesdays during the computing lab section. Students will also have the opportunity to work together and ask the instructor questions during other lab sections before each assignment is due. Each problem set will be worth 10 points.
-   **Midterm project:** Students will write a report on how they will use a model from the course to address a sustainability problem of interest. The midterm project will be used as a foundation for the final project. (20 points)
-   **Final project:** Students will expand on their midterm project, performing a detailed model analysis and discussing the implications of their results for designing sustainability interventions. (40 points)


## Course expectations

Setting expectations early, I hope, helps everyone get the most out of our shared experience in the course. There are things you can expect from me and things I expect of enrolled students. 

### What you can expect from me

I will do my best to promote an encouraging and safe learning environment to
promote student success. I will strive to understand and support student career
goals. I welcome a diversity of backgrounds and experiences. You can expect me
to challenge and cheer on students to refine their own ideas through clear
writing. While I enjoy and have developed my talent for mathematics and computer programming, I understand that these subjects can cause some anxiety. If you feel this anxiety and have ideas on how I can help that I am not doing, you can expect me to welcome feedback and work with you to find accommodations for life events that interfere with completion of any of the six assignments.

Please see me during office hours or by making an appointment at another time over email.


### What is expected from all students

Students must attend all scheduled course meetings unless there are extenuating circumstances. Students are expected to seek help if they are struggling with course material, assignments, or have any other issues.

### What is expected from graduate students

Graduate students will be required to complete an extra exercise on each problem set that will be extra credit for undergraduates. Graduate student writing and programming will in general be held to a higher standard in terms of clarity, structure, and technical detail.

### Course outline with more course content details

1.  Computational social science can help design sustainability interventions.
    Social science theory provides models of repeated human interaction over
    time that can be used, for example, to represent [Ostrom's eight "design
    principles" for sustainable socio-ecological
    systems](https://earthbound.report/2018/01/15/elinor-ostroms-8-rules-for-managing-the-commons/).

    -   Lab: Introducing the *80% success rate* exercise, "How much advertising
        is necessary for an 80% success rate in spreading a sustainable
        innovation in groups, given population size and average number of
        acquaintances of people in the group?"

2.  How human psychology, groups, and social networks can promote or inhibit the
    diffusion of sustainable innovations, Part I: single-group social networks.

    -   Lab: Could innovation-supporting social networks also promote inequality
        [@Moser2023]?

3.  How human psychology, groups, and social networks can promote or inhibit the
    diffusion of sustainable innovations, Part II: two-group (or more) social
    networks, i.e., *metapopulation* social networks.

    -   Lab I: 80% success rate exercise with two-group social networks defined
        by each group's *homophily* level, i.e., tendency of group members to
        interact with others from their own group [@Turner2023].

    -   Lab II: Use stochastic block model to infer networks from data
        [@DeBacco2023; @Ross2024].

4.  Social influence: understanding the effect of rhetoric as a force that acts
    on opinions and beliefs. How to measure opinion dynamics and

    -   Lab I: When is polarization path-dependent and therefore possible to
        avoid [@Turner2018]?
    -   Lab II: Opinion dynamics measurement depends on accurate inference using
        categorical (Likert-style) observational data [@Liddell2018].

5.  The emergence of cooperation via reciprocity: application to groundwater
    sustainability. How to predict and restrict potential free-riding based on
    marginal utility in managing common pool resources using game theory (see
    @Jackson).

    -   Lab I: "Groundwater sharing dilemma" (as we'll call it, though it's just
        a re-telling of the famous [prisoners'
        dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma))
    -   Lab II: Agent-based model of behavioral study of "avoidance of
        disastrous climate change in a public goods game" by @Tavoni2011

6.  Ideal institutions support human cooperation by balancing variation and
    maintenance of beneficial behaviors within and between stakeholder groups
    [@Richerson2016d; @Waring2015]. Example: sustainable agricultural practices
    like crop switching [@Waring2023; @Kling2024].

    -   Lab I: The evolution of property rights supports sustainability
        [@Waring2017]. What sorts of social networks evolve? Could alternatives
        better promote or inhibit the development and diffusion of innovations?
