# Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the course website for Computational Social Science for
Sustainability, developed and taught by Dr. Matthew Turner, and offered Winter
2025 for Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability undergraduates and graduate
students! Join the course to develop a nuanced understanding of human social
behavior while learning new computational and presentation skills in the R
programming language.

## Course structure

Each week will have a Monday lecture on topics in computational social science
followed by a Wednesday lab-focused session to develop students' scientific
programming and writing skills. Listed below is a weekly schedule of lecture
topics and lab exercises. Details about course structure are subject to change.

There will be eight weekly assignments that we will begin during Wednesday lab
sessions. There will be a midterm and final project, with the final project
ideally building on results from the midterm project. There will be a midterm
and final exam to test students' conceptual understanding of computational
social science topics covered in the course and readings.

## Lecture and lab outline

1.  Computational social science can help design sustainability interventions.
    Social science theory provides models of repeated human interaction over
    time that can be used, for example, to represent [Ostrom's eight "design
    principles" for sustainable socio-ecological
    systems](https://earthbound.report/2018/01/15/elinor-ostroms-8-rules-for-managing-the-commons/)
    in a mathematically rigorous way.

    -   Lab: Introducing the *80% success rate* exercise, "How much advertising
        is necessary for an 80% success rate in spreading a sustainable
        innovation in groups, given population size and average number of
        acquaintances of people in the group?"

2.  How human psychology, groups, and social networks can promote or inhibit the
    diffusion of sustainable innovations, Part I: single-group social networks.

    -   Lab I: 80% success rate exercise, but now with different types of social
        networks.
    -   Lab II: Could innovation-supporting social networks also promote
        inequality [@Moser2023]?

3.  How human psychology, groups, and social networks can promote or inhibit the
    diffusion of sustainable innovations, Part II: two-group (or more) social
    networks, i.e., *metapopulation* social networks.

    -   Lab I: 80% success rate exercise with two-group social networks defined
        by each group's *homophily* level, i.e., tendency of group members to
        interact with others from their own group [@Turner2023].

    -   Lab II: Use stochastic block model to infer networks from data
        [@DeBacco2023; @Ross2024].

4.  Social influence: understanding the effect of rhetoric as a force that acts
    on opinions and beliefs. How to measure opinion dynamics and
    -   Lab I: Identifying optimal order of interactions to reduce polarization
        through agent-based social influence modeling [@Turner2018].
    -   Lab II: Accurate inference of continuous opinion dynamics using
        categorical (Likert-style) observational data [@Liddell2018].
5.  The emergence of cooperation via reciprocity: application to groundwater
    sustainability. How to predict and restrict potential free-riding based on
    marginal utility in managing common pool resources using game theory (see
    @Jackson).
    -   Lab I: "Groundwater sharing dilemma" (as we'll call it, though it's just
        a re-telling of the famous [prisoners'
        dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma))
    -   Lab II: Agent-based model of behavioral study of "avoidance of
        disastrous climate change in a public goods game" by @Tavoni2011
6.  Ideal institutions support human cooperation by balancing variation and
    maintenance of beneficial behaviors within and between stakeholder groups
    [@Richerson2016d; @Waring2015]. Example: sustainable agricultural practices
    like crop switching [@Waring2023; @Kling2024].
    -    Lab I: The evolution of property rights supports sustainability
        [@Waring2017]. What sorts of social networks evolve? Could alternatives
        better promote or inhibit the development and diffusion of innovations?

The ten-week course will consist of ten full lectures and ten sections focused
on computing skills with some lecture, but mostly hands-on practice to make sure
students learn the skills they need to complete weekly project assignments.
Weekly assignments will combine software development and writing, requiring
students to write a mini 2-page journal article-style papers every week.
Students will motivate and explain a model they help program, analyze model
outputs and explain the results, and explain the broader importance of the work.
These papers will follow the IMAD structure: Introduction, Model (or Methods),
Analysis, and Discussion, also known as the IMRaD structure where "Results and"
replaces "Analysis".

### Grading

-   *Weekly assignments:* There will be eight weekly assignments total, taking
    weeks off for midterm and final weeks to focus on projects and exams. Each
    will be worth 10 points.
-   *Midterm and final exams:* There will be a midterm and final written exam
    possibly including written mathematics, mathematical derivations, and
    pseudocode solutions to logic or programming problems. The midterm exam will
    be worth 20 points; the final will be 30 points.
-   *Midterm project:* 30 points
-   *Final project:* 40 points

## Weekly assignment

10 points per weekly assignment: I, 2pts; M 2pts, Code 3pts; R 3pts; D 1 pt.

## Midterm exam:

Written responses, formal calculations, explaining formalisms, writing
pseudocode 20 pts

## Final exam:

Written responses, formal calculations, explaining formalisms, writing
pseudocode 40 pts

## Midterm project:

Pick one of the weekly assignments and expand upon it based upon your own
interests. Same grading as weekly project, but scaled up to 20 points. Minimum
2000 words in IMAD/IMRaD format.

## Final project

I will suggest several potential final projects, and students may invent their
own. Same grading distribution as weekly project, but scaled up to 40 points.
Minimum 3000 words in IMAD/IMRaD format.
