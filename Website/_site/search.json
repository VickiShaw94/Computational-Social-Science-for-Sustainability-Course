Wednesday meetings will focus on developing programming, analysis, and writing skills in an interactive lab-section setting. In these Wednesday sections students will be introduced to problem sets and midterm and final projects, and have time to work together with the instructor and peers.\n\nCoursework and Grading\nStudents will be evaluated based on their completion of six assignments worth 100 points total: four problem sets (10 points each), a midterm project (20 points), and a final project (40 points). Undergraduate students will have the opportunity for bonus points on each problem set.\n\nProblem sets: There will be four problem sets introduced on Wednesdays during the computing lab section. Students will also have the opportunity to work together and ask the instructor questions during other lab sections before each assignment is due. (10 points per problem set)\nMidterm project: Students will write a report on how they will use a model from the course to address a sustainability problem of interest. The midterm project will be used as a foundation for the final project. (20 points)\nFinal project: Students will expand on their midterm project, performing a detailed model analysis and discussing the implications of their results for designing sustainability interventions. (40 points)\n\n\n\nLate coursework policy\nIf there is a family or health emergency or other acute distress please contact me to make arrangements to submit late work without penalty. Otherwise the following policy applies:\n\nProblem sets up to 72 hours late can receive 50% credit.\nProblem sets up to one week late can receive 20% credit.\nThe midterm project may be submitted up to one week late to receive 50% credit.\nThe final project may not be submitted late.\nNo credit will be given for work beyond one week late."

Students will learn transferrable technical skills in programming and mathematics. Students will deepen their interdisciplinary understanding of the social and behavioral sciences. With these skills and understanding, students will be empowered to create research products that analyze and evaluate potential sustainability interventions using computation.\n\nLearning goals\nThrough participation in lecture and lab sections and completion of course activities, students will\n\nlearn modern approaches to scientific modeling and statistical analysis of social behavior\nlearn to develop, implement, and analyze their own models for designing sustainability interventions\nlearn to write effective research papers using the Introduction, Model, Analysis, Discussion structure\nimprove their R programming skills, including the popular tidyverse, for simulation modeling and data science see the R for Data Science book for more details.\n\n\n\nExpectations\nUnderstanding mutual expectations can help everyone succeed.

Failure to do so is a violation of Stanford’s Honor Code and is a serious offense, even when the violation is unintentional. Conduct prohibited by the Honor Code includes all forms of academic dishonesty, among them unpermitted collaboration and representing others’ work as one’s own.
