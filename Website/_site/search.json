    "text": "Hello, and welcome to the course website for Computational Social Science for Sustainability, developed and taught by Dr. Matthew Turner, and offered Winter 2025 for Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability undergraduates and graduate students! Join the course to develop a nuanced understanding of human social behavior while learning new computational and presentation skills in the R programming language.\n\n\nOne of the most helpful things students can do is speak up early if they are having trouble. Please email me or seek the help of other enrolled students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach week will have a Monday lecture on topics in computational social science for sustainability. Wednesday meetings will focus on developing programming, analysis, and writing skills in an interactive lab-section setting. In these Wednesday sections students will be introduced to problem sets and midterm and final projects, and have time to ask questions of and work together with the instructor and peers.\n\n\nStudents will be evaluated based on their completion of six total assignments: four problem sets, a midterm project, and a final project.\n\nProblem sets: There will be four problem sets introduced on Wednesdays during the computing lab section. Students will also have the opportunity to work together and ask the instructor questions during other lab sections before each assignment is due. Each problem set will be worth 10 points.\nMidterm project: Students will write a report on how they will use a model from the course to address a sustainability problem of interest. The midterm project will be used as a foundation for the final project. (20 points)\nFinal project: Students will expand on their midterm project, performing a detailed model analysis and discussing the implications of their results for designing sustainability interventions. (40 points)\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting expectations early, I hope, helps everyone get the most out of our shared experience in the course. There are things you can expect from me and things I expect of enrolled students.\n\n\nI will do my best to promote an encouraging and safe learning environment to promote student success. I will strive to understand and support student career goals. I welcome a diversity of backgrounds and experiences. You can expect me to challenge and cheer on students to refine their own ideas through clear writing. While I enjoy and have developed my talent for mathematics and computer programming, I understand that these subjects can cause some anxiety. If you feel this anxiety and have ideas on how I can help that I am not doing, you can expect me to welcome feedback and work with you to find accommodations for life events that interfere with completion of any of the six assignments.\nPlease see me during office hours or by making an appointment at another time over email.\n\n\n\nStudents must attend all scheduled course meetings unless there are extenuating circumstances. Students are expected to seek help if they are struggling with course material, assignments, or have any other issues.\n\n\n\nGraduate students will be required to complete an extra exercise on each problem set that will be extra credit for undergraduates. Graduate student writing and programming will in general be held to a higher standard in terms of clarity, structure, and technical detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday lectures and Wednesday lab sections 11:30 AM - 12:50 PM in 320-109, Winter quarter 2025.\n\n\n\n\nMonday and Tuesday 1 - 3 PM (Y2E2 352)\nThursday 3 - 4 PM (Zoom; link to be shared on Canvas)\nBy appointment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\n\n\nTopic\n\n\nCoursework\n\n\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1, M 1/6 and W 1/8\n\n\nWhat is social science, why computation, and how these can promote sustainability.\n\n\n\n\nPS 1, diffusion via social learning: How many individuals need to be know about beneficial sustainable innovations so that they spread throughout a population?

Social science theory provides models of repeated human interaction over time that can be used, for example, to represent Ostrom’s eight “design principles” for sustainable socio-ecological systems.\n\nLab: Introducing the 80% success rate exercise, “How much advertising is necessary for an 80% success rate in spreading a sustainable innovation in groups, given population size and average number of acquaintances of people in the group?”\n\nHow human psychology, groups, and social networks can promote or inhibit the diffusion of sustainable innovations, Part I: single-group social networks.\n\nLab: Could innovation-supporting social networks also promote inequality (Moser and Smaldino 2023)?\n\nHow human psychology, groups, and social networks can promote or inhibit the diffusion of sustainable innovations, Part II: two-group (or more) social networks, i.e., metapopulation social networks.\n\nLab I: 80% success rate exercise with two-group social networks defined by each group’s homophily level, i.e., tendency of group members to interact with others from their own group (Turner et al. 2023).\nLab II: Use stochastic block model to infer networks from data (De Bacco et al. 2023; Ross, McElreath, and Redhead 2024).\n\nSocial influence: understanding the effect of rhetoric as a force that acts on opinions and beliefs. How to measure opinion dynamics and\n\nLab I: When is polarization path-dependent and therefore possible to avoid (Turner and Smaldino 2018)?\nLab II: Opinion dynamics measurement depends on accurate inference using categorical (Likert-style) observational data (Liddell and Kruschke 2018).\n\nThe emergence of cooperation via reciprocity: application to groundwater sustainability. How to predict and restrict potential free-riding based on marginal utility in managing common pool resources using game theory (see (Jackson?)).\n\nLab I: “Groundwater sharing dilemma” (as we’ll call it, though it’s just a re-telling of the famous prisoners’ dilemma)\nLab II: Agent-based model of behavioral study of “avoidance of disastrous climate change in a public goods game” by Tavoni et al. (2011)\n\nIdeal institutions support human cooperation by balancing variation and maintenance of beneficial behaviors within and between stakeholder groups (Richerson et al. 2016; Waring et al. 2015). Example: sustainable agricultural practices like crop switching (Waring et al. 2023; Kling et al. 2024).\n\nLab I: The evolution of property rights supports sustainability (Waring, Goff, and Smaldino 2017). What sorts of social networks evolve? Could alternatives better promote or inhibit the development and diffusion of innovations?"

Students will also have the opportunity to work together and ask the instructor questions during other lab sections before each assignment is due. Each problem set will be worth 10 points.\nMidterm project: Students will write a report on how they will use a model from the course to address a sustainability problem of interest. (20 points)\nFinal project: Students will expand on their midterm project, performing a detailed model analysis and discussing the implications of their results. (40 points)"
