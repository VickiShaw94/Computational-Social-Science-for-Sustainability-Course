Join the course to develop a nuanced understanding of human social behavior while learning new computational and presentation skills in the R programming language.\n\n\nWe meet twice weekly, currently scheduled for Monday and Wednesday 11:30am-12:50pm, but subject to change, location pending. Each week will have twin themes, one social science phenomenon (e.g., political polarization) and one computational technique or skill (e.g., agent-based modeling)."
