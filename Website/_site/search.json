    "text": "Hello, and welcome to the course website for Computational Social Science for Sustainability, developed and taught by Dr. Matthew Turner, and offered Winter 2025 for Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability undergraduates and graduate students! Join the course to develop a nuanced understanding of human social behavior while learning new computational and presentation skills in the R programming language.\n\n\nEach week will have a Monday lecture on topics in computational social science followed by a Wednesday lab-focused session to develop students’ scientific programming and writing skills. Listed below is a weekly schedule of lecture topics and lab exercises. Details about course structure are subject to change.\nThere will be eight weekly assignments that we will begin during Wednesday lab sessions. There will be a midterm and final project, with the final project ideally building on results from the midterm project. There will be a midterm and final exam to test students’ conceptual understanding of computational social science topics covered in the course and readings.\n\n\n\n\nComputational social science can help design sustainability interventions. Social science theory provides models of repeated human interaction over time that can be used, for example, to represent Ostrom’s eight “design principles” for sustainable socio-ecological systems in a mathematically rigorous way.\n\nLab: Introducing the 80% success rate exercise, “How much advertising is necessary for an 80% success rate in spreading a sustainable innovation in groups, given population size and average number of acquaintances of people in the group?”\n\nHow human psychology, groups, and social networks can promote or inhibit the diffusion of sustainable innovations, Part I: single-group social networks.\n\nLab I: 80% success rate exercise, but now with different types of social networks.\nLab II: Could innovation-supporting social networks also promote inequality (Moser and Smaldino 2023)?\n\nHow human psychology, groups, and social networks can promote or inhibit the diffusion of sustainable innovations, Part II: two-group (or more) social networks, i.e., metapopulation social networks.\n\nLab I: 80% success rate exercise with two-group social networks defined by each group’s homophily level, i.e., tendency of group members to interact with others from their own group (Matthew A. Turner et al. 2023).\nLab II: Use stochastic block model to infer networks from data (De Bacco et al. 2023; Ross, McElreath, and Redhead 2024).\n\n\n\n\nSocial influence: understanding the effect of rhetoric as a force that acts on opinions and beliefs. How to measure opinion dynamics and\n\nLab I: Identifying optimal order of interactions to reduce polarization through agent-based social influence modeling (Matthew A. Turner and Smaldino 2018).\nLab II: Accurate inference of continuous opinion dynamics using categorical (Likert-style) observational data (Liddell and Kruschke 2018).\n\nThe emergence of cooperation via reciprocity: application to groundwater sustainability. How to predict and restrict potential free-riding based on marginal utility in managing common pool resources using game theory (see (Jackson?)).\n\nLab I: “Groundwater sharing dilemma” (as we’ll call it, though it’s just a re-telling of the famous prisoners’ dilemma)\nLab II: Agent-based model of behavioral study of “avoidance of disastrous climate change in a public goods game” by Tavoni et al. (2011)\n\nIdeal institutions support human cooperation by balancing variation and maintenance of beneficial behaviors within and between stakeholder groups (Richerson et al. 2016; Waring et al. 2015). Example: sustainable agricultural practices like crop switching (Waring et al. 2023; Kling et al. 2024).\n\nLab I: The evolution of property rights supports sustainability (Waring, Goff, and Smaldino 2017). What sorts of social networks evolve? Could alternatives better promote or inhibit the development and diffusion of innovations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ten-week course will consist of ten full lectures and ten sections focused on computing skills with some lecture, but mostly hands-on practice to make sure students learn the skills they need to complete weekly project assignments. Weekly assignments will combine software development and writing, requiring students to write a mini 2-page journal article-style papers every week. Students will motivate and explain a model they help program, analyze model outputs and explain the results, and explain the broader importance of the work. These papers will follow the IMAD structure: Introduction, Model (or Methods), Analysis, and Discussion, also known as the IMRaD structure where “Results and” replaces “Analysis”.\n\n\n\nWeekly assignments: There will be eight weekly assignments total, taking weeks off for midterm and final weeks to focus on projects and exams. Each will be worth 10 points.\nMidterm and final exams: There will be a midterm and final written exam possibly including written mathematics, mathematical derivations, and pseudocode solutions to logic or programming problems. The midterm exam will be worth 20 points; the final will be 30 points.\nMidterm project: 30 points\nFinal project: 40 points\n\n\n\n\n\n10 points per weekly assignment: I, 2pts; M 2pts, Code 3pts; R 3pts; D 1 pt.\n\n\n\nWritten responses, formal calculations, explaining formalisms, writing pseudocode 20 pts\n\n\n\nWritten responses, formal calculations, explaining formalisms, writing pseudocode 40 pts\n\n\n\nPick one of the weekly assignments and expand upon it based upon your own interests. Same grading as weekly project, but scaled up to 20 points. Minimum 2000 words in IMAD/IMRaD format.\n\n\n\nI will suggest several potential final projects, and students may invent their own. Same grading distribution as weekly project, but scaled up to 40 points. Minimum 3000 words in IMAD/IMRaD format."
