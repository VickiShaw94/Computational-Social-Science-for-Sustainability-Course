Final question for the group: 

- How do you define sustainability?

## _Sustainability_

## *Social Science for Sustainability*

- Elinor Ostrom led development of _social-ecological systems_ theory, which
identified _design principles_ to help sustain _common-pool resources_.
    - First woman to win a Nobel prize in economics (2009)

- A _common-pool resource_ is something like clean water or healthy forests;
  all the common-pool resources together are called the commons.

Select *design principles* (8 total; see @Cox2010 reading for an overview):

- Rules should fit local circumstances
- Participation of _all_ stakeholders is vital
    - Management of the commons must be organized across social and
      institutional scales
    - All levels of social hierarchy must be recognized and free to organize
- Conflict resolution should be easily accessible

## *Social Science for Sustainability*

Ostrom's work elevated traditional, Indigenous adaptations for a changing
climate (always been changing) and other sustainability challenges.

## *Social Science for Sustainability*

Two observations:

1. Not all sustainable, adaptive behaviors 

## Computational social science for sustainable behaviors



## Computational social _science_

- We use the scientific method, starting from the high school version:
    1. Hypothesize what causes some phenomenon 
    1. Gather evidence to support your explanation
    1. Evaluate the hypothesis (true, false, in-between)
    1. Repeat
- In computational social science we develop computer and mathematical models to analyze data and deduce the consequences of repeated social interactions subject to certain assumptions.

## The (computational social scientific) method

- We develop hypotheses 


# Diffusion of innovations

## How likely is the diffusion of an innovation?

- How many early-adopter _influencers_ must know a behavior in order to spread it?
- How does the perceived benefit of a behavior affect the spread of behavior?

- A _vertice_ represents a person with a unique id

- Two simulated people interact if and only if an edge connects them
- How many potential teachers does each person have?
