Final question for the group: 

- How do you define sustainability?

## _Sustainability_

## *Social Science for Sustainability*

- Elinor Ostrom led development of _social-ecological systems_ theory, which
identified _design principles_ to help sustain _common-pool resources_.
    - First woman to win a Nobel prize in economics (2009)

- A _common-pool resource_ is something like clean water or healthy forests;
  all the common-pool resources together are called the commons.

Select *design principles* (8 total; see @Cox2010 reading for an overview):

- Rules should fit local circumstances
- Participation of _all_ stakeholders is vital
    - Management of the commons must be organized across social and
      institutional scales
    - All levels of social hierarchy must be recognized and free to organize
- Conflict resolution should be easily accessible

## *Social Science for Sustainability*

Ostrom's work elevated traditional, Indigenous adaptations for a changing
climate (always been changing) and other sustainability challenges.

## *Social Science for Sustainability*

Two opportunities to complement Ostrom's socio-ecological systems program:

1. Complementary _deductive_ methods could predict the outcomes of
      candidate _interventions_ to promote sustainability.
    - Ostrom and colleagues developed the design principles _inductively_, based on
      decades of rigorous empirical research. 
2. Cooperation is not always necessary 
   in order to gain individual-level benefits and affect sustainability.
   - Walking, biking, or EVs instead of internal combustion engine commuting
   - Heat pumps and solar panels to reduce carbon-intensive energy generation

## Computational social _science_

- We use the scientific method, starting from the high school version:
    1. Hypothesize what causes some phenomenon 
    1. Gather evidence to support your explanation
    1. Evaluate the hypothesis (true, false, in-between)
    1. Repeat

- In computational social science we develop computer and mathematical models to analyze data and deduce the consequences of repeated social interactions subject to certain assumptions.


# A simple example to introduce Computational Social Science for Sustainability: the Influencer dynamic.

## The Influencer

- Oftentimes people will eventually adopt a behavior if they observe an
"influencer". 
- If we are designing a sustainability _intervention_, we may 
want to know how long it will take for everyone who is influenced by an influencer
to adopt some behavior...

## The Influencer

Let's model how long it will take for everyone who is influenced by this influencer
to adopt the behavior of commuting on bike!
